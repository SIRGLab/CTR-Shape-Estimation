# CTR Shape Estimation

Python implementation of the shape estimation methodology presented in the following paper: "Shape Estimation of Concentric Tube Robots Using Single Point Position Measurement". E. Mackute, B. Thamo, K. Dhaliwal, M.Khadem. 2022 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS).

CTR_Observer.py provides a fusion algorithm that combines a sensor measurement with the mathematical model of a concentric tube robot (CTR). The CTR_Observer class is based on the CTR model implementation available at https://github.com/SIRGLab/CTR_Python_Model.

demo.py shows an example of using this repository.
